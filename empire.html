        <b>Origins:</b>The Marathas were primarily a Marathi-speaking warrior group from the present-day state of
        Maharashtra. They had been under the rule of various Islamic dynasties for centuries.
        Shivaji's Rise:Shivaji, born into a Maratha noble family, recognized the potential of his people and the
        vulnerability of the ruling powers. He embarked on a mission to establish an independent Maratha kingdom. <br/> <br/>
        <b>Guerrilla Tactics:</b>Shivaji employed innovative guerrilla tactics, combining military prowess with
        political acumen. He successfully captured several forts from the Bijapur Sultanate and the Mughals. <br/> <br/>
        <b>Administrative Reforms:</b>Shivaji was not just a warrior; he was also a skilled administrator. He
        established a well-organized administration, efficient revenue collection system, and a strong naval force.
